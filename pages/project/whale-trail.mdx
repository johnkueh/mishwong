## Setting the scene

The Whales Tohora exhibition is a temporary exhibition at the Australian Museum
in Sydney running from October 2018 to April 2019.

The purpose of the project is to increase engagement during the exhibition period and to
drive visitors to other parts of the museum. With target visitors being older kids and young adults,
the game needed to encourage discovery and interactivity.

## Challenges

The first challenge was designing the storyline of the game. We had to map out the interactive experience
so that the museum can start writing content and curating images for it.

We thought it was good to feature just a few whale species; so users can spend quality time at each stop.
Early concepts explored included a map, a family tree and a simple list.

## Solution

We decided to present the game as a simple list. Because the whales are scattered in different buildings in the Australian Museum,
having a large map on a small screen will introduce unnecessary clutter. A family tree feels very scientific and uninviting.
With a simple list, the whale illustrations stand out more and there is a clear call to action (tap on a whale to get to know it).

At each stop, users can see the whale come to live, read fun facts, listen to the sound of whales,
answer a quiz to test their knowledge and get to know the whale’s family. To bring the whale to live,
they look for a label with the image of the whale and a QR code. Then it's as simple as scanning the QR code
with their phone’s camera to see it come alive in the museum.
