## Setting the scene

The Whales Tohora exhibition is a temporary exhibition at the Australian Museum in Sydney running from October 2018 to April 2019. The purpose of the project is to increase engagement during the exhibition period and to drive visitors to other parts of the museum. With target visitors being older kids and young adults, the game needed to encourage discovery and interactivity.

## Challenges

The first challenge was designing the storyline of the game. We had to map out the interactive experience so that the museum can start writing content and curating images for it.

We thought it was good to feature just a few whale species; so users can spend quality time at each stop. Early concepts explored included a map, a family tree and a simple list.
