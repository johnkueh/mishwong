## Setting the stage

FrogID is Australia’s national citizen science project that will help provide valuable data for the protection and conservation of frogs. Anyone will be able to record the sound of frogs calling on their phones with the FrogID mobile app wherever they are at.

The existing mobile app will need a landing page as a hub for all information on the project. My role was to design the landing pages - I defined user task flows, created wireframes, mocks and prototypes for all the pages.

## Landing page challenges

The goal of the landing pages was to create an emotional connection between users and FrogID by getting the project’s story across, house information about the project and increase downloads of the FrogID mobile app.

One of the challenges was defining the structure of the website and limiting the site to only a few pages as necessary. Each page should have a clear call-to-action (CTA) and not be overloaded with information.

## Learnings

This project made me think more deeply about landing pages. Some things that stuck with me are:

* The importance of visual hierarchy - making sure the headlines and main call-to-action stand out first and foremost. Also, that each content type has its own place and not compete or drown out one another.
* The use of white space - breathing space between sections creates a pleasant browsing experience and enhances readability
* Content is king - to consider what a content's purpose is and the best format to convey it
