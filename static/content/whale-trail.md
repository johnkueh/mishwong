## Setting the scene

The Whales Tohora exhibition is a temporary exhibition at the Australian Museum in Sydney running from October 2018 to April 2019. The purpose of the project is to increase engagement during the exhibition period and to drive visitors to other parts of the museum. With target visitors being older kids and young adults, the game needed to encourage discovery and interactivity.

Using VR technology, users were able to partake in experiences the average museum visitor never gets to see.

## Challenges

One of the major challenges was the content strategy and game storyline. We had to map out the interactive experience so that the museum can start writing content and curating images for it and we can start bringing the idea to live.

Some of the early concepts we explored included a whale trail map, a family tree and a simple list of whales.

## Solution

We decided to present the game as a simple list. Because the whales and whale artifacts are scattered in different buildings in the Australian Museum, having a large map on a small screen will introduce unnecessary clutter. A family tree feels quite scientific and uninviting. With a simple list of whales, the whale illustrations can stand out more on mobile and ensure a pleasant experience for museum goers.

At each stop, users can see the whale come to live, read fun facts, listen to the sound of whales, answer a quiz to test their knowledge and read more to get to know the whale’s family. To bring the whale to live, they look for a printed label with the image of the whale and a QR code. Then, it's as simple as scanning the QR code with their phone’s camera to see it alive in the museum. We decided collectively to feature only a few whale species; so users can spend quality time at each stop.
