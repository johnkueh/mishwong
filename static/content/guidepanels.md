## Challenge

Sometimes itâ€™s not easy understanding what products can achieve through its landing page. Illustrations are key to help people come to an understanding and create a pleasant user experience. The challenge was to create a set of illustrations and icons for the landing pages and product that tell its story and is consistent throughout.

## Process

I first define the colour palette so that the illustrations will appear as a set. Then I do a Google image search for the key words I would be illustrating to get ideas and to make sure they do not have a double meaning. I do a rough sketch on paper, put on some good music and jump straight into Illustrator.
